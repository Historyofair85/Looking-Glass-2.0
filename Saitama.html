            <p> Being the strongest man in the universe comes with its own struggles. Saitaima often gets over looked by other heros and villains because of his appearence and demeamor. Though he is the strongest, he often tries to live an ordinary life. Whether it is fighting crime or catching the latest sale on meat at his local supermarket, Saitama handles the day that's given to him with humility and understanding.

                I must remind myself that I am only human and mistakes can and will happen. There is no use on looking ahead and worrying about issues that have yet to come. 
                <br>
                Instead I must focus on what I can do today and make the best decicions I can in the present.
                Decisions that I believe will set me up better for tomorrow and for the days to come.
