        <p> The future Hokage didn't start off the strongest, the smartest, or the most gifted.
            What he did have was an unbreakable self-belief that one day he would be the most influencial ninja with in the Hidden Village of the Leaf.

            For these next 10 weeks, its certain many of us will be spending countless hours engulfed in the world of programming. Though we may put in the hours, its self-belief that will push us through to the next level.
            <br>
            <br>
            I myself have struggled with this, sometimes giving up before I ever reach the top of the wave to crest over. I must believe that I can overcome the self doubt. Believe in the decisions I have made and see it through to the end.
