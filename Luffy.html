                Being a wanted pirate in the blue sea doesn't stop Luffy from taking on any adventure. He often times risks his own life for the greater goals that his crew share together.

                I know many of us, including myself, are taking a risk doing a full-time bootcamp. Some have left fortifed careers while others have had to build the strength recently to try something different. Dont be nervous, you are not alone in this journey.

                We all took this step to reach for a better future. Hats off to you....lets win together.
