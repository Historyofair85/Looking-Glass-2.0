               Before Simon became an explorer of the stars and a fighter for humanity, he was just a scared child living under the ground looking for anything to give him hope. Through perservience, trust, and above all....guts; he managed to leave his underground home and see the universe as a its protector.

               At times we get into our own way. Before making the decison to sign up for this bootcamp, I thought to myself that there was no way I would go back to school. That the safest and most logical decison was to continue working in the field I was already in for the little stability I had.
               <br> 
               <br>
                I rejected common sense and belived in myself that I could create a better future for not only me, but for my identical twin daughters that already see me as a super hero.

                Heros make the impossible...possible. Even though this bootcamp may seem impossible at first, I have more than enough to try my hardest to show my children that their vision of me is correct.
